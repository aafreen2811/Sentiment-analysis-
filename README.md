# Sentiment Analysis of COVID-19 Tweets  
*A data analytics capstone project by Zara (Aafreen)*

## ðŸ§  Project Overview  
In this project, I perform sentiment analysis on tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The main goal is to classify tweets as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** and uncover insights into how public sentiment evolved during the crisis.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Clean and preprocess real-world tweet data (remove noise, handle missing values).  
- Explore the data via EDA: word clouds, sentiment trends over time, top hashtags, etc.  
- Build classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, XGBoost, K-NN, SVM) to predict tweet sentiment.  
- Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- Visualize results and draw meaningful conclusions about public sentiment during the pandemic.
